# Hey, I'm Tanay.

I build web apps that people actually want to use.
I use: JavaScript/TypeScript, Vue/Nuxt, React/Next.js, Go—and whatever gets the job done fast and right.

## What I'm working on

**[Nuxflare](https://nuxflare.com)** — Open-source CLI tool for deploying Nuxt apps to Cloudflare (alternative to NuxtHub)  
**[Foo Studio](https://foo.studio)** — My design/dev agency where we build websites, MVPs, and AI tools for startups

## Other projects
